# HealthDataAnalysis
This repository contains a case study on 'Analyzing Health Data for a Community Health Program' where we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset 'Health Data'. The goal of this analysis is to assess the effectiveness of a community health program and make informed decisions for future interventions.

## Data Description

The data provided for analysis includes the following variables:
- ID: Unique identifier for each participant.
- Age: Age of the participant.
- Gender: Gender of the participant (Male/Female).
- Ethnicity: Ethnic background of the participant.
- Pre-Weight (kg): Weight of the participant before the program.
- Pre-Height (cm): Height of the participant before the program.
- Pre-BMI: Body Mass Index before the program.
- Pre-Hypertension: Whether the participant had hypertension before the program (Yes/No).
- Pre-Obesity: Whether the participant was obese before the program (Yes/No).
- Post-Weight (kg): Weight of the participant after the program.
- Post-Height (cm): Height of the participant after the program.
- Post-BMI: Body Mass Index after the program.
- Post-Hypertension: Whether the participant had hypertension after the program (Yes/No).
- Post-Obesity: Whether the participant was obese after the program (Yes/No).

## Analysis Tools

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical tests were performed in R using libraries such as readxl, dplyr, and statsmodels, including visualizations in SPSS such as pie charts, histograms, box plots, and bar charts along with their statistical summaries.
